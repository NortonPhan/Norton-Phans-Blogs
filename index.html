                <p class="text-muted text-left">San Francisco was a blast. The city's pride and joy, the Golden Gate Bridge, was beatiful. Especially at nighttime, the light illuminated the golden-like bridge to the whole city. Me, my sister and my cousins were pretty excited to be driving on the bridge. I dont remember the trip entirely, for we went  here years ago. We took many pictures and went back to our town. Speaking of our town, it was pretty cool. The most memorable part of the town was the bungee jump. Yeah, right in town. I don't really remember if I built up the courage to do a flip on the trampoline but it was a blast anyways. </p>

The beaches were extremely nice, and the pool areas, they were amazing. In the Bahamas, its not like and regular pool area in your average state. There were multiple food bars, and most importantly: a Super Slide! Thats right, I even went on it. Climbing up, I was completely terrified for my life. When I was going down, it felt like I was completely free falling. There was also a super slide located somewhere else, but with sharks! But of course my protective mother would never let me go on that slide no matter how old I was. </p>

               <h4>Illinois Researchers Working to Save Ornate Box Turtles</h4>

FRANKLIN GROVE, Ill. (AP) — A team of Illinois researchers is using dogs to track down a threatened species of turtle.

Researchers believe ornate box turtles, once living in half of Illinois’ 102 counties, are found in less than 10.

One known home for the species is in Lee County, and a team from the Chicago Zoological Society and the University of Illinois spent Friday surveying the 3,800-acre (1,500-hectare) Nachusa Grasslands.

A team paced through the grasses trying to spot the small turtles, aided by a group of Boykin spaniels that can sniff out the turtles’ trail. When a human or a dog located a turtle, researchers made notes about the reptile’s eyes, ears, nose and took physical measurements along with a blood sample.

Ornate box turtles’ shells have distinct yellow markings in a sunburst pattern. They typically weigh about a pound and are 3 or 4 inches (8 to 10 centimeters) in length, said Dr. Matt Allender, the Chicago Zoological Society clinical veterinarian and director of the University of Illinois Wildlife Epidemiology Laboratory.

The health study is in its 15th year. The data collected during Friday’s survey will be added to previous years’ findings to help researchers determine what is threatening the environment and health of the ornate box turtles.

“Ornate box turtles are sentinels of environmental and ecosystem health, so they utilize both land and water sources, just like humans do in this environment,” Allender said. “And so the health of the ornate box turtle is a reflection of the health of the environment that we draw our natural resources on.”</p>

               <h4>US Sets Aside Habitat Critical for Survival of Rare Songbird
</h4> 
                <img src="https://www.moppenheim.tv/wp-content/uploads/AP21111551937404_Final.jpg" class="col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12">
                <p id="bird" class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">U.S. wildlife managers have set aside vast areas across several states as habitat critical to the survival of a rare songbird that migrates each year from Central and South America to breeding grounds in Mexico and the United States.

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced the final habitat designation for the western yellow-billed cuckoo on Tuesday. It covers about 467 square miles (1,210 square kilometers) along hundreds of miles of rivers and streams in the western states.

Most breeding in the U.S. occurs in Arizona and New Mexico, but the habitat designation also includes areas in California, Colorado, Utah, Texas and Idaho.

The designation isn’t as big as initially proposed. Wildlife managers opted to exclude more than 300 square miles (777 square kilometers) of potential habitat after considering updated information about ongoing conservation activities, the lack of suitable habitat in some areas and potential interference with critical infrastructure.

“This designation identifies important feeding and breeding grounds for the cuckoo to support the species’ recovery while also balancing the need in finding solutions that support current and future land-use plans,” Michael Fris, field supervisor for the Sacramento Fish and Wildlife Office, said in a statement.

A habitat plan that spanned more than 850 square miles (2,200 square kilometers) was first floated in 2014 but never approved. The Trump administration proposed a smaller area in 2020, prompting the latest round of public comments. As a result, the designation issued this week by the Biden administration was further reduced.

“This failure reflects the real need for the Biden administration to bring in new leadership and reform the agency,” said Brian Segee, a senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity, a group that works to protect endangered species.

Federal biologists describe the cuckoo as an elusive species. Difficult to observe, it selects its nesting spots based on habitat conditions and the availability of food. That means breeding habitat not suitable one year may become suitable the next due to increased rainfall or flooding, while favorable areas might degrade the next year.

Each spring and fall, the cuckoo uses river corridors as routes to travel between its wintering and breeding grounds. Nesting pairs find refuge in willows, cottonwoods and other trees along waterways and once their chicks hatch, their voracious appetites for insects help them fuel up for the return trip south.

Listed as threatened in 2014, biologists say the bird has seen population declines due to loss of riparian habitat and habitat fragmentation resulting from agriculture, dams and river management, erosion, overgrazing and competition from exotic plants.</p>

Its about these siblings, Jack and Annie, use this magic treehouse and go back in time to the dinosaur age. The reader can learn a lot of the dinosaur's nature, its habitat, and much other things. Learning about dinosaurs was really fun especially in this style of informative writing. You should definitely check out the other books as well. <br>
